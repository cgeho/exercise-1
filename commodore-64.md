The <b>Commodore 64</b>, also known as the <b>C64</b> or the <b>CBM 64</b>, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units.
<br>
Part of the Commodore 64's success was its sale in regular retail stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores. Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs, including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology. Approximately 10,000 commercial software titles have been made for the Commodore 64 including development tools, office productivity applications, and video games.
